## What is it?

A short web scraping script to analyze the price of every beer option sold in Ontario and write the results to Excel. 

## Why bother?

I wanted to try using multithreading in my software, as it hadn't been taught to me yet. The signle threaded version of this script took almost 7 minutes to run. Using multithreading I was able to get the time down to roughly a minute and a half.

Last time I ran this script there were over 2,700 types of beer being sold by The Beer Store in Ontario. Using this script I was able to identify the most cost effective beer of them all after about 90 seconds, without looking up the prices of 2,700 beers and running the numbers myself.
